# sstlr-v1

I've decided that I have to pursue a new project, a new path, and that "animation spoofers" won't cut it for me, so here I've open-sourced SStlr V1 for anyone to take, use, sell, whatever.


**Why?**

Well I've decided that if I wanna keep growing as a developer sticking to a project won't cut it, specially if it's a project where I'm not learning anything, just doing the usual thing every day.


**Why open-source V1?**

I wanted to open-source this version of SStlr V1 cause it was already leaked (a previous version) long ago and so that people can actually read the full code without any kind of obfuscation. Sell it if you wanna, I don't care, just don't contact me about it.


**Where are you headed?**

Well now I'll probably go on to work with the GoDot engine, might still do some things on Roblox, and I wanna focus on mainly finding something I enjoy doing with code, without requiring any engine. An application, software. Regardless of whether it's something simple or something big, I want to make sure I enjoy doing it. I wanna learn, study, and understand more about IT. In a few years I'll be going to England to work with something related to IT, and I wanna make sure I don't disappoint people that have high hopes for me, like a friend of mine from the US that is a big inspiration for me, and my brothers. I think I owe them that for everything they've done for me.


**What's gonna happen to V2?**

To put it simple, I'll keep making keys in an alt account and I won't reply to any messages as I'll only go there on the weekends, make keys, and leave for another week.


Well, like Lotto said in 8 Mile:

And all's well that ends okay,
So I'll end this shit with a "Fuck you", but have a nice day!
